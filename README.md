# discourse-auxy-theme

An unofficial auxy theme for Discourse.

* Font (thanks to https://github.com/chipthrasher/auxy)
* 'Purple Green Orange' color scheme
* [Discourse button styles](https://github.com/awesomerobot/discourse-button-styles) (5px radius)

(Ideally you would have imported https://github.com/t1-tracey/discourse-auxy-theme-base, and import https://github.com/awesomerobot/discourse-button-styles as theme component.) :(
